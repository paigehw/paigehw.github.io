## Welcome to Paige's Website

Here's my [wordpress page](https://paigehwilliams.wordpress.com), I'm trying to figure them both out-- hopefully I'll learn something!

The theme I'm using is called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/paigehw/paigehw.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
